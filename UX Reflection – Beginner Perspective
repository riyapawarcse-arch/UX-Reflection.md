# UX Reflection – Beginner Perspective

## What is UX Reflection?
UX reflection is the process of thinking about how a user experiences an app,
what feels easy, confusing, or distracting, and why it matters.

## What I Observed
While using apps like Amazon, Google Pay, and LinkedIn, I noticed that
design clarity and content prioritization play a major role in user focus.

## What I Felt as a User
- Too many elements at once can feel overwhelming
- Clear layouts help users complete tasks faster
- Personalization improves long-term engagement

## What I Learned
Good UX is not only about visuals, but about:
- Reducing user confusion
- Saving user time
- Guiding users toward their goals

## Reflection as a Student
As a beginner in product and UX analysis, this exercise helped me
understand how small design choices impact user behavior.
