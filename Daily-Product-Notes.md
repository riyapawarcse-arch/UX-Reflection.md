## Observation – LinkedIn (Web)

Today I observed LinkedIn from a normal user perspective.

The app provides a lot of information at once, which is useful but sometimes distracting.
As a user, my intention was to look for career-related content, but the feed included
many unrelated posts, ads, and suggestions.

This made me realize that while LinkedIn is informative, better content prioritization
could improve user focus, especially for students.
