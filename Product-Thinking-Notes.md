# Product Thinking – Beginner Notes

## What is Product Thinking?
Product thinking means understanding a problem before building a solution.
It focuses on the user, the business, and long-term impact.

## Key Questions a Product Thinker Asks
- Who is the user?
- What problem are they facing?
- Why does this problem matter?
- What is the simplest solution?

## What I’m Learning
- Not every feature adds value
- Simplicity is more powerful than complexity
- User experience affects business outcomes

## My Current Focus
As a student, I am learning how real products work in everyday life
and how small improvements can create better user experiences.
